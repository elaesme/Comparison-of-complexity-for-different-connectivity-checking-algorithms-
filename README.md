# Comparison-of-complexity-for-different-connectivity-checking-algorithms-

The aim of this project was comparing time complexity of 3 different graph connectivity-check algorithms;
Irreducibility method, Eigenvalue of Laplacian Method and Breadth-First-Search Algorithm by
simulating different graphs for different number of nodes with Python programming language.
